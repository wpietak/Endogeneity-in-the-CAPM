# **Endogeneity-in-the-CAPM**

This repository involves my own research on the problem of endogeneity in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). I present the problem and the sources of endogeneity in CAPM, show how to approximate the resulting estimation bias and assess its impact in certain uses, such as VaR, and propose ways of adjusting the estimator to reduce the bias. Apart from the basic definitions, all the ideas, formulas, derivations and calculations are developed fully by me, unless specified otherwise.

## Introduction

CAPM is a broadly utilized model in the financial industry.
